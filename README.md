# robothon-ctrl-arm-del

This repository will contain the source-code for an ESP32-powered humanoid robotic arm, as our team's submission to the Triton Droids Robothon 2.0 (running 'till May 17). I'm keeping it public just because, but until this README says otherwise, any code in here is NOT finished and will likely not work correctly :P
